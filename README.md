##   1. Project Description

This C++ console application was developed using object-oriented programming principles to help vehicle owners track and manage maintenance services performed on their vehicles. The system supports multiple owners, each with a collection of vehicles. Users can register detailed information about owners and their vehicles, log performed services with cost and descriptions, and view complete maintenance reports.

The project demonstrates encapsulation, class composition, dynamic memory usage, and basic I/O operations within the context of a practical and realistic scenario.
